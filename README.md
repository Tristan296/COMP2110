# COMP2110 Portal: Group 2 Web Application Overview:
This web app was developed using [Lit Web Components](https://lit.dev/). 
This application has the following functionality
* users can login and logout
* displays the most recent blog posts
* the layout changes depending on whether a user is logged in or not
* creating a new post refreshes the blog, not the whole page
* the user cannot enter a null title (the web app assigns a default title)
* if the user leaves the content field in their new post blank, they are prompted to enter text
    (the user is prevented from submitting blank content to the server)
* the blog loads new content automatically every 10 seconds, allowing it to function more as a chatroom

It also includes four widgets integrated into the overall design. 
## About our group: 
Group two is made up of the following individuals: 
((put your name, user ID here))
* Stacey Purcell, 42123682. 
* Tristan Norbury, 47308028.

# Who did what?
## Integration of Individual Widgets 
* Tristan Norbury, post meme image url and url (button) - which is then fetched from the blog posts array and displayed as an image, Post meme caption - posts the associated meme's caption as a quote. Fetch new meme (button) - retrieves a new random meme by choosing a random index from the imgflip meme array.

# Boilerplate 'starter code' documentation: 
The boilerplate and starter code remains a product of the COMP2110 Web Development Collective Â© 2023. The following documentation was provided for the boilerplate.
## Installation

The project has no external dependencies, it uses Lit via a CDN load directly into
the HTML page.   Node is used only to run a local HTTP server.

```bash
npm install
```

Will install the `http-server` node module.

```bash
npm start
```

will run the server.

## Backend Server

Your portal will make use of a server that we have implemented that is running on <https://comp2110-portal-server.fly.dev/>.   Documentation for the services it provides
is in [this Github repository](https://github.com/COMP2110-2023/comp2110-portal-server/).

## Starter Code

The code included here implements the basic framework for the application, including
an overall page structure and the blog, login and advertising components.  If you run
the application you will see the basic page with space for a number of _widgets_.  
You will fill these slots with your own widgets - one per team member. (A _widget_
is a name for an element of a graphical user interface, basically the same as a
component).

The module `config.js` exports a variable `BASE_URL` that contains the address
of the backend server. This is used for example in the blog-block component
to define the URL endpoint.  You may also want to use it if you make use of
other API endpoints from the server (eg. tasks).

The code contains implementations of the following components:

### `<comp2110-portal>`

This is a container for the whole portal application and currently contains 
some of the pre-defined widgets.  You can modify this as you see fit to achieve
your overall application layout and behaviour.

### `<widget-column>`

This component implements a container for widgets and can be used to define
the style information and layout for the group.  You can modify this if you
wish or replace it with something else.

### `<login-widget>`

This component implements a login form that will allow a user to authenticate to the
backend server.   If the user is logged in, the component displays their name and
a logout button rather than the form.  

Authentication is implemented in the `auth.js` module.  Once a user login succeeds,
the current user details are stored in the browser [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API) so that
they persist over browser sessions.  In your code, you can use the function
`getUser()` from the `auth.js` module to find out if a user is logged in and get
their details.  

### `<blog-block>`

This component implements a blog using the backend API from the COMP2110 portal server.
You can modify this component if you wish to change the layout of posts or the overall look and feel.  

This component only supports reading posts although the backend API allows posting new blog
posts if you are logged in.  One possible extension of this component would be to allow
posting in some way.

### `<ad-widget>`

This component displays an advertisement from the backend portal server. You should not
modify it and it should appear somewhere in your page design.
