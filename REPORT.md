# Group 2 Report on Web Development Project
Outline:
1. Details of your deployment and where your application can be accessed (URL).
2. What you achieved: a short (few paragraphs) description of what your group has implemented; highlight any extensions or additional work you did.
3. What did you find challenging: tell us what was hard about completing the project. This might be technical (understanding the API) or organisational (communication within the group). 
4. What was rewarding: one or two things that you were able to do that you feel contributed to your understanding of the content of this unit.
5. Individual reflection: each team member should write one paragraph on their personal experience (include your name):
-which widget did you choose and why?
-what was the most challenging part of the project for you?

## Deployment
-TBD (likely cloudfare)

## Achievements


### Extensions (may not need as heading as may simply be addressed through regular paragraphs)

change in appearance depending on if user is logged in or logged out
pop-out blog post
- clearing on submission
- different error messages if fields are left blank/auto filled if submit was hit
widgets had additional features (show new joke, trivia, meme etc., post meme to blog page)
blog post had additional feature (show images)

## Challenges we faced

- responsiveness
- blog null check
-used the issues function to help delegate the different issues/challenges we encountered within our code
-did not struggle with communication as a group -- group discord + having class together + issues function on github, all worked well

## Aspects we found rewarding
